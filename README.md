## The **gt** Workshop

This **gt** workshop will teach you about what **gt** can do, and, it'll give you an opportunity to experiment with the package. It's available as a Posit Cloud project, and that makes it easy to get up and running.

The goal of the workshop is to introduce you to a lot of examples and provide some time to generate some sample tables, learning bit-by-bit as we go.

Each module of the workshop focuses on a different family of functions, with relevant examples and exercises in each. They are all presented here as **Quarto** (.qmd) files with one file for each workshop module:

- `"01-create-table.qmd"` (The *Create Table* Family of Functions)
- `"02-create-modify-parts.qmd"` (The *Create/Modify Parts* Family of Functions)

- `"02z-PRACTICE-01-02.qmd"` (Practice with functions from modules `01` and `02`)

- `"03-format-data.qmd"` (The *Format Data* Family of Functions)
- `"04-modify-columns.qmd"` (The *Modify Columns* Family of Functions)

- `"04z-PRACTICE-03-04.qmd"` (Practice with functions from modules `03` and `04`)

- `"05-summaries.qmd"` (The *Add Rows* Family of Functions)
- `"06-table_option_functions.qmd"` (The Family of *Table Option Functions*)

- `"06z-PRACTICE-05-06.qmd"` (Practice with functions from modules `05` and `06`)

You can navigate to any of these and modify the code within the self-contained code chunks. Entire **Quarto** files can be rendered to HTML.

### Installing **gt**

You can install **gt** on your system by using `install.packages()`:
