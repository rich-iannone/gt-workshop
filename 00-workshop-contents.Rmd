This **gt** workshop will teach you *a lot* about what **gt** can do, and, it'll give you an opportunity to experiment with the package. 

The goal of the workshop is to introduce you to a lot of examples and provide some time to generate some sample tables, learning bit-by-bit as we go.

Each module of the workshop focuses on a different family of functions, with relevant examples and exercises in each. They are all presented here as **R Markdown** (.Rmd) files with one file for each workshop module:

- `"01-create-table.Rmd"`

- `"02-create-modify-parts.Rmd"`

- `"02z-PRACTICE-01-02.Rmd"`

- `"03-format-data.Rmd"`

- `"04-modify-columns.Rmd"`

- `"04z-PRACTICE-03-04.Rmd"`

- `"05-summaries.Rmd"`

- `"06-table_option_functions.Rmd"`

- `"06z-PRACTICE-05-06.Rmd"`

You can navigate to any of these and modify the code within the self-contained **R Markdown** code chunks. Entire **R Markdown** files can be knit to HTML, where a separate window will show the rendered document.

### Installing **gt**

You can install **gt** on your system by using `install.packages()`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("gt")
```
